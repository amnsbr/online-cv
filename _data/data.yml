    title: About Me
    summary: |
      I have studied medicine at Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. Afterwards, I 
      joined Institute of Medical Science and Technology to do neuroimaging research, 
      which is at the intersection of my interests in neuroscience, mathematics, and 
      medical research. More specifically, I am using coordinate-based meta-analysis, in addition to 
      functional and structural MRI methods to better understand the brain abnormalities in 
      multiple sclerosis, and depression, as well as normal brain function in motor learning and pain.
